# MyFirstWebScraping
This small code collects data from the local server data (game results) from the site marathonbet.ru To make the code work you need to download the html page on the site https:/marathonbet.ru/sport/results , then install on the local Openserver server.  
All this works on Python+Scrapy + Selenium libraries
